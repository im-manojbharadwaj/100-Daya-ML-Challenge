# Day-7-ML-Challenge

This is Day 7 Machine Learning Challenge.

Today's topic of core "Seaborn" as Day 6 Challenge covered more of "Matplotlib" questions!

In today's challenge, you do not require dataset as this is also a form of test how you load the data set which is already available at seaborn dataset url.

Good Luck Designing Amazing Plots!
