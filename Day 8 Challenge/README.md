# Day-8-ML-Challenge

This is Day 8 Machine Learning Challenge.

Infact I must say this is more of a examination for you guys how well you're prepared with KNN Algorithm.
Problem statement is to use KNN Algorithm to predict the Iris flower into their classified breed.

Good Luck Predicting Flowers into their classification!
